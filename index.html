<p class="p1"> These shoes will be able to provide the most comfort, the material carries a knit sock effect which gives it a very nice texture. This shoe is also very light, only weighing 250g! And the reason why you will be buying this shoe is because it carries the logo 'sockshoes' and because of this, these shoes will retail for $800nzd.

<p class="p1"> This shoe will give you the most comfort, but instead of one sole there will be THREE. This will significantly increase the bulkiness of the shoe. The material included will also heavily increase the weight will also coming along with a shoe box that is five times the size of a normal one. No fear, despite these shoes having more cons than pros you will still buy it at a retail price of $1400nzd.

<p class="p1">This is exactly the same as a t-shirt. But more ridiculous. The material is of any standard BUT, there is two t-shirt. One is different color and you have two options of which one to wear, a 2 in 1. You will buy this because of the brand and will only retail for only $1800nzd.</p>
